        <h2>India Gate</h2>
        <p>The India Gate (formerly known as the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath,
            on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Kingsway. It stands as a memorial to
            90,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in
            France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the
            Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom,
            are inscribed on the gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the
            memorial arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and
            the Gateway of India in Mumbai.

            Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a
            reversed
            rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This
            structure,
            called Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb of the
            unknown
            soldier. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime
            Minister visits the gate to pay their tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day
            parade
            starts. India Gate is often a location for civil society protests.</p>
        <p>At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway in the middle
            of a crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who
            lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I. The memorial bears the names of more
            than 13,516 British and Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919.

            The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was
            designed by Edwin Lutyens. The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then Viceroy, Lord
            Irwin. Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was added much later, after India got its independence. The
            eternal flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives
            in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.

            The entire arch stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge moulding. The
            cornice is inscribed with the Imperial suns while both sides of the arch have INDIA, flanked by the dates
            MCMXIV (1914 left) and MCMXIX (1919 right). The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with
            burning oil on anniversaries but this is rarely done.

            During nightfall, India Gate is dramatically floodlit while the fountains nearby make a lovely display with
            coloured lights. India Gate stands at one end of Rajpath, and the area surrounding it is generally referred
            to as 'India Gate'.

            Surrounding the imposing structure is a large expanse of lush green lawns, which is a popular picnic spot.
            One can see hoards of people moving about the brightly lit area and on the lawns on summer evenings.</p>
